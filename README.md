## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ or Bun 1.0+
- MongoDB Atlas account
- Stripe account
- Vercel account (for Blob storage)

## Getting Started

### Installation

#### Using Bun (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/code-with-antonio/next15-multitenant-ecommerce.git
cd multitenant-ecommerce

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env
```

#### Using npm

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/code-with-antonio/next15-multitenant-ecommerce.git
cd multitenant-ecommerce

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env
```

#### Using yarn

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/code-with-antonio/next15-multitenant-ecommerce.git
cd multitenant-ecommerce

# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env
```

### Environment Variables

Update the `.env` file with your configuration:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URI=your_mongodb_uri
PAYLOAD_SECRET=your_payload_secret

# Global
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_ROOT_DOMAIN=localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SUBDOMAIN_ROUTING=false

# Stripe
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_stripe_webhook_secret

# Vercel Blob
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=your_vercel_blob_token
```

### Subdomain Routing Configuration

The platform supports wildcard subdomain routing, allowing each vendor to have their own unique subdomain (e.g., `vendorname.yourdomain.com`). This feature is controlled by the `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SUBDOMAIN_ROUTING` environment variable.

#### Development
By default, subdomain routing is disabled in development (`NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SUBDOMAIN_ROUTING="false"`), and all stores are accessed through routes like:
```
http://localhost:3000/tenants/[tenant-slug]
```

#### Production
To enable subdomain routing in production:

1. Configure your DNS provider with a wildcard subdomain record:
   ```
   *.yourdomain.com  →  your-vercel-deployment.vercel.app
   ```

2. Update your environment variables:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ROOT_DOMAIN=yourdomain.com
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SUBDOMAIN_ROUTING="true"
   ```

Once enabled, stores will be accessible through their unique subdomains:
```
https://tenantslug.yourdomain.com
```

#### Notes
- Make sure your hosting provider (e.g., Vercel) supports wildcard subdomains
- Each subdomain will automatically serve the corresponding store's content
- SSL certificates should be configured to support wildcard subdomains
- The main marketplace will remain accessible at your root domain

### Database Setup

#### Recommended Approach (Works with both Bun and Node.js)
```bash
# Reset database (drops all collections)
bun run db:fresh
# or
node scripts/reset-db.mjs

# Seed the database with initial data
bun run db:seed
```

#### Using Standard Payload Commands (if compatible)
```bash
# Using npm (if available)
npm run db:fresh
npm run db:seed

# Using yarn (if available)
yarn db:fresh
yarn db:seed
```

**Note:** The `db:fresh` command uses a custom script that directly resets the MongoDB database, bypassing Payload CLI compatibility issues with Bun.

# Using yarn
yarn db:fresh
yarn db:seed
```

### Development

```bash
# Using Bun
bun run dev

# Using npm
npm run dev

# Using yarn
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Troubleshooting

## Troubleshooting

### Database Migration Issues with Bun

If you encounter errors like "Cannot find module 'tsx://...' " when using Payload CLI commands, this project includes a custom database reset script that bypasses these compatibility issues:

**Solution:**
```bash
# Use the working database reset
bun run db:fresh

# Then seed the database
bun run db:seed
```

The `db:fresh` command uses a direct MongoDB connection to reset the database, which is more reliable than the Payload CLI with Bun.

### Common Issues

- **TypeScript/tsx loading errors**: Solved by using the custom database reset script
- **Undici version conflicts**: Bypassed by avoiding the Payload CLI for database operations
- **Permission errors during migration**: Make sure the database connection string is correct in your `.env` file
- **Collections not recreated**: Run `bun run dev` once after database reset to let Payload recreate the collections automatically
